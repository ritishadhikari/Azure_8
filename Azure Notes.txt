Deployment Models:

Public Cloud : A service provider makes resources, such as applications and storage available to the general public over the internet. Easy and Inexpensive. 

Private Cloud : Offers hosted service to a limited number of people behind firewall so it minimizes the security concerns. This gives companies direct control over their data. 

Hybrid Cloud : Uses a mix of on-premises, private cloud and third party public cloud services. Helps to leverage the best of both worlds.
